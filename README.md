The website I made for Hurstpierpoint College's Young Enterprise team 2012-2013 - Enigma

It features a rotating version of our main product - the Glug Mug - added from a tutorial by Hearcode.

This was a learning project for me as I attempted to create a single page website, using jQuery to help me handle the animations. The majority of this website was created from scratch by me with very few components taken from across the web.
